I've recently completed a project where I built a logistic regression model to predict breast cancer using the popular Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset.
Key Highlights:
Data Preparation: The dataset includes features such as Clump Thickness, Uniformity of Cell Size, and more, with the target variable indicating whether a tumor is benign or malignant.
Model Training:
Split the data into training and test sets.
Trained a logistic regression model to classify tumors.
Model Evaluation:
Achieved an accuracy of 96.70% with a standard deviation of 1.97% using k-fold cross-validation.
Confusion matrix results: [[84 3]
                          [ 3 47]]
Key Takeaways:
Logistic Regression proved to be a robust method for binary classification tasks in medical diagnostics.
The high accuracy and low standard deviation demonstrate the model's reliability.
Iâ€™m excited about the potential of machine learning in healthcare and eager to explore more in this domain.
